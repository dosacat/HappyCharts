Prompt - Build a page that allows the user to visualise and update an employee organization chart
interactively with drag & drop.

Link to website: https://happy-charts.onrender.com/  

My approach to the problem:  
1. Divided the screen into navbar, sidebar and main components.  
2. Built filters - search and drop drown in the sidebar.  
3. In the main, used react chart library to render hierachy data built from the array.  
4. Minimal styling and colours for design.  

Known issues:  
1. Styling issues in the search and dropdown sizing, employee cards.
2. If you search team name in the search bar, the chart will not transform, it only responds to the dropdown.  
3. Drag and Drop does not work in the chart and does not update data as a result.  
4. Design could better accomodate varying screens.  

Notes from me:
The comments I would not leave in production, comments were there primarily for the reviewer.  
The chart library I used, uses drag and drop in it to allow dragging nodes, however it threw errors when dropping nodes.

What I could have done better:  
1. Used state management like Redux
2. Built the org chart from scratch -Tree component from Material UI to render the hierachy data and use react-beautiful-dnd on it.
3. Improved CSS! - Modern styling, improved accesibility and responsive design.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
